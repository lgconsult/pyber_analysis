# pyber_analysis

## Overview
The purpose of our analysis is to gather our statistics based on the city type.

## Results
![Summary Data Frame](https://github.com/lgconsult/pyber_analysis/blob/main/pyber%20summary%20dataframe.png)
The results of our analysis show the differences between urban, suburban, and rural cities in multiple categories. As is logical urban cities have the the most total rides, total drivers, and average fare per ride followed by suburban cities and rural cities. When calculating the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver, rural cities post the highest return, followed by suburban cities and then urban cities.

## Summary
Based on the results of our data we can make three recommendations. The first is that the company should try to raise the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver in urban cities. These metrics are both significantly less than suburban  and rural cities and point to missed revenue that could be captured. The second recommendation is that the company should try to lower fares in rural areas. The average fare per driver and the average fare per rider could be dragging down total rides and total drivers, utlimately hurting the bottom line in these areas. The last recommendation is that the company could also try to increase the total fares in rural areas while not increasing average fare per ride or average fare per driver. 
My line chart appears to have a disparity in the first week of April for Urban and Suburban cities. While all of my previous tables look the same I'm not sure why the resampled data frame is showing week 4/7 for these two city types as so low.
